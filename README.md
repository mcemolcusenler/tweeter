# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Its purpose was to gain experience with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, jQuery and AJAX. Additionally, Google Fonts, MomentJS and Font Awesome were used in order to enhance the User Experience. On the back-end the project utilizes Node, Express and MongoDB.

Tweeter is an app where Users can send and like tweets. The database keeps track of any changes made to the "likes" of a tweet and renders the page accordingly.
